# Jarvis Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a simple voice assistant built using Python. It can respond to voice commands, perform tasks like searching Wikipedia, opening websites, playing music, and more. The assistant also features a "Wikipedia Mode" that allows users to control when Wikipedia searches are enabled.

## Features

- **Voice Commands**: Interact with Jarvis using natural voice commands.
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Search Wikipedia in "Wikipedia Mode."
- **Custom Tasks**: Perform actions like opening websites, playing music, and telling the time.
- **Flexible Interaction**: Toggle features like Wikipedia Mode on or off as needed.
- **Exit Command**: Stop Jarvis by saying "exit."

## Customization

1. **Music Directory**:
   Update the `music_dir` variable in `main.py` with the path to your music folder:
   ```python
   music_dir = 'path_to_your_music_folder'
   ```

2. **Wikipedia Mode Behavior**:
   Modify the logic to suit your interaction preferences in the `main.py` script.

3. **Voice Settings**:
   Customize the voice and speed of Jarvis:
   ```python
   engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)  # Use [1] for a different voice
   engine.setProperty('rate', 150)  # Adjust the speed (default: 200)
   ```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Microphone Not Detected**:
   Ensure your microphone is properly connected and configured as the default recording device.

2. **PyAudio Error**:
   If you encounter a `pyaudio` installation issue, install it with:
   ```bash
   pip install pipwin
   pipwin install pyaudio
   ```

3. **Wikipedia Page Error**:
   Ensure the topic exists on Wikipedia or try searching for a broader term.

## Future Improvements

- Add more voice-controlled tasks.
- Enhance the assistant's ability to understand and respond naturally.
